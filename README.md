# cruddy-todo
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

## High Level Goals of this Sprint
- Dive deeper into Async code using standard nodejs callbacks patterns
- Continue to gain an understanding of RESTful APIs and CRUD
- Learn about promises and how they simplify async callback pattern in nodejs
- Practice ignoring complexity by keeping clear of non-relevant areas of the codebase
